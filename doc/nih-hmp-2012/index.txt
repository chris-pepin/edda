NIH HMP Workshop / Knight Lab - Apr 2012
========================================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Metagenomic assembly in the cloud

Paper drafts
------------

`Partitioning/probabilistic de Bruijn graph paper draft <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/dec-11/kmer-percolation-posted.html>`__

`Digital normalization paper draft <http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-12/diginorm-paper-posted.html>`__

A demo, and some useful links
-----------------------------

You can see static versions of the ipython notebooks for the demo here:

 1. `Digital normalization of the HMP mock data set <files/91-mock-diginorm.html>`__
 2. `Partitioning the HMP mock data set <files/92-mock-partition.html>`__
 3. `Assembling the partitioned HMP mock data set <files/93-mock-assemble.html>`__

**To run the demo yourself**, do the following:

1. Start up ami-f525fc9c on EC2, with ~16gb of RAM or more; I suggest
   using an m2.xlarge machine.

2. Make sure HTTPS is open on the firewall.

3. Use your Web browser to connect to 'https://' + hostname; use the password
   gadzooks.

4. Click on 'clusters' tab, put '4' into the nbserver '# of engines', and click
   'start'.

5. Go back to 'notebooks' tab and start at 91-mock-dataset-diginorm.  Open it
   up, and select 'Cell' menu and then 'Run all'.  Alternatively, start at
   the top and hit 'SHIFT-Enter' on each cell to run it.

See :doc:`../tutorials-2011/creating-an-ec2-instance` for some details
on Amazon EC2, and check out `this Youtube video
<http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaS4NXxL5Qc>`__ for more info on
ipython notebook.

The khmer software is available at http://github.com/ctb/khmer/ and
the scripts are `documented here
<http://lyorn.idyll.org/~t/khmer/scripts.html>`__.

Older tutorials
---------------

:doc:`../diginorm-2012/index` -- The paper notes and data analysis pipeline
for the digital normalization paper.  The data analysis pipeline stuff
is not for metagenomes, however; it describes microbial genome assembly
and eukaryotic transcriptome assembly.

:doc:`../metag-assembly-2011/index` -- A slightly older (but more
comprehensive) introduction to metagenome assembly, from an MSU-local workshop.

Note that there are tons of other tutorials for all sorts of things next-gen-sequence-y here: :doc:`../tutorials-2011/index`.
