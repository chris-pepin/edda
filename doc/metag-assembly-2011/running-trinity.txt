Running Trinity in da cloud
===========================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Follow :doc:`starting-your-cloud-system` up until "Getting data".
Use the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) ami-2946a740 (Debian 6.0).

You should now be logged in at a prompt that looks something like this::

   ip-10-243-151-85:~#

Install necessary software by running::

   %% apt-get update
   %% apt-get -y --force-yes install libbz2-1.0 libbz2-dev libncurses5-dev openjdk-6-jre-headless zlib1g-dev

(copy/paste, ignoring the '%%' -- that just means it's a shell command).

Now, change to the /mnt directory and download Trinity::

  %% cd /mnt
  %% curl -L 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/trinityrnaseq/trinityrnaseq_r2011-11-26.tgz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Ftrinityrnaseq%2F&ts=1325692775&use_mirror=cdnetworks-us-2' > trinityrnaseq_r2011-11-26.tgz

Next, unpack Trinity and build it::

  %% tar xzf trinityrnaseq_r2011-11-26.tgz
  %% cd trinityrnaseq_r2011-11-26
  %% make

Finally, run the test script. ::

  %% cd sample_data/test_Trinity_Assembly/
  %% bash runMe.sh

Your assembly will be in ::

  /mnt/trinityrnaseq_r2011-11-26/sample_data/test_Trinity_Assembly/trinity_out_dir/Trinity.fasta

A few notes --

 * when you shut the system down, all your data and results will go
   away forever, unless you save them!  You can copy them off using
   scp or Dropbox (see :doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`),
   or save it on Amazon disks using an EBS volume (see
   :doc:`../tutorials-2011/creating-ebs-volume`).

 * be sure to shut down the system (using either 'shutdown -h now' at
   the command line, or 'Terminate Instance' at the AWS console) when
   you're done.  Otherwise YOU WILL BE CHARGED $$ even if you're not
   running any processes.

 * Pick the appropriate `instance type
   <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#instance>`__ (most especially
   memory/RAM!) for your data set size.  Trinity is a memory hog and
   usually you will want to pick 34GB or 68GB of RAM.  (`This may not
   be that cheap <http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing>`__ ;).  Note the
   number of cores so that you can adjust Trinity command line
   parameters to use them all.
