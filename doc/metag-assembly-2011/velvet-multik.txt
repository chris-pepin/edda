Merging Velvet multi-k assemblies
=================================

Patrick Chain's group at LANL has developed an approach to merge
regular Velvet assemblies with multiple ks using a program called
minimus2.  Let's try it out!

First, install some necessary software::

  %% apt-get -y --force-yes install mummer libxml-parser-perl libexpat1-dev
  %% ln /usr/bin/show-coords /usr/local/bin

Now, download CD-HIT, it's a softward package which clusters sequences by
similarity; we use it to dereplicate our contigs. ::

  %% cd /mnt
  %% curl -O http://cdhit.googlecode.com/files/cd-hit-v4.5.7-2011-12-16.tgz

Configure & build it::

   %% tar xzf cd-hit-v4.5.7-2011-12-16.tgz
   %% cd cd-hit-v4.5.7-2011-12-16
   %% make
   %% make install
  
Now, download AMOS, the parent package containing minimus2::

  %% cd /mnt
  %% curl -L http://sourceforge.net/projects/amos/files/amos-3.1.0-rc1.tar.gz/download > amos-3.1.0-rc1.tar.gz

Configure & build it::

  %% tar xzf amos-3.1.0-rc1.tar.gz
  %% cd amos-3.1.0-rc1
  %% ./configure
  %% make
  %% make install
  %% cp bin/* /usr/local/bin

Go to corn::

  %% cd /mnt/corn
  %% cat corn31.fa corn33.fa > all-corn.fa

You must now uniquely rename your combined contigs.  We also only consider contigs longer than 200 bp for further processing. ::
 
  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/multi-rename.py all-corn.fa > all-corn.fa.renamed.200

Next, we dereplicate sequences by removing redundant sequences which our 99% similar. ::

  %% cd-hit-est -i all-corn.fa -o all-corn.cdhit.out -c 0.99 

Next, we merge the contigs. ::

  %% toAmos -s all-corn.cdhit.out -o all-corn.afg
  %% minimus2 all-corn

This will produce files 'all-corn.fasta' (the merged contigs) and 'all-corn.singletons.seq' (the unmerged singletons).  Combine these files with the following command. ::

  %% cat all-corn.fasta all-corn.singletons.seq > all-merged-corn-contigs.fa

Now, let's check out the final assembly. ::

  %% python /mnt/khmer/sandbox/assemstats3.py 100 smallcorn.k25.k35-contig.fa  corn.*/*contigs.fa all-merged-corn-contigs.fa

  ** cutoff: 100
  N       sum     max     filename
  4826    1296668 4082    smallcorn.k25.k35-contig.fa
  7661    1664903 4296    corn.31/contigs.fa
  8177    1784032 4167    corn.33/contigs.fa
  2250    1147502 11801   corn.33/meta-velvetg.contigs.fa
  5986    1635992 5020    all-corn.fasta
  --
  TOTAL: 7.5291e+06 in 28900 contigs (mean size 261)

OK.  Now we've given you at least three different ways of generating
metagenome assemblies.  Which one is best??

We don't really know.  We're currently using the minimus2 approach, because
we think it does a decent job, but we can't really justify it to you yet :).
