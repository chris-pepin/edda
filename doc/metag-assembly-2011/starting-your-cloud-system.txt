Introducing Amazon EC2
----------------------

Amazon EC2 -- EC2 stands for "Elastic Cloud Computing" -- is a service
by which Amazon rents you a remote computer on an hourly basis. The
only access to this computer is over the network, with SSH.

Setting up an account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amazon provides a lot of services through what it calls "Amazon Web
Services".  To get started, go to http://aws.amazon.com/ and sign
up for an account; it can be linked to your Amazon account.

Once you have an AWS account, sign up for Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2).

You'll need to provide a credit card to pay for your default account
use, but (if you're doing this as part of the NGS or BEACON courses) the
course can pay for your AWS usage during the course.

Log in to Amazon Web Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to http://aws.amazon.com/.

"Sign in to the AWS Management Console".  (You'll need to sign up for
an account if you haven't already done so; it's separate from your
regular Amazon account.)

Enter your username and password, etc.

Ask Amazon to start a new computer up for you
---------------------------------------------

You should now see the "Amazon EC2 Console Dashboard".  Click on
"Launch Instance".

Now, you'll see a 'request instances wizard' window next.  This will
give you the option of selecting what *kind* of operating system you
want running on the computer.

Select the "Community AMIs" tab.

Next to "Viewing all images", enter ami-67fe300e -- (this might be a
good place to copy/paste...) and hit "return".  You should see one
entry, containing the text "ged.msu.edu/..." under Manifest.  Select
it.

The next screen lets you specify a bunch of stuff -- "Number of instances",
or, number of computers to start up; "Availability zone", or the region
where you want this to be started; and "Instance type", the size and
speed of the computer.  Leave these all as default, and click Continue.

The next screen, "Advanced Instance Options", gives you additional ways
to customize the computer.  Just leave everything as default and select
"Continue".

The next screen, "create key pair", lets you tell Amazon who has access
to your machine.

   :width: 90%

Put 'amazon' in the name box.

The private keyfile that is generated will be named 'amazon.pem' and
it will be automatically downloaded and placed on your machine; this
will depend on where your Web browser places files.  We'll need it
later, so you should track it down :).  If asked, put it on your
Desktop.

Next, you'll have to define security settings.

.. image:: images/ec2-default-security-group.png
   :width: 90%

You'll need to allow SSH connections in by "adding a rule" for SSH:

   :width: 50%

-----

Finally, at the Review screen, you can see a summary -- just click
"Launch".

.. image:: images/ec2-launch.png
   :width: 90%

Now you should see a screen that says "your instances are now launching".
Click "View your instances on the Instances page".

Hooray!

Logging into your new instance "in the cloud"
---------------------------------------------

OK, so you've created a running computer.  How do you get to it?

The next thing you'll need is the network name of your new computer.
To retrieve this, go to the instance view and click on the instance,
and find the "Public DNS".  This is the public name of your computer
on the Internet.

Copy this name, and connect to that computer with ssh under the username
'root'.

On Mac OS X:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, start up Terminal.app.  It should be in /Applications/Utilities
on all Macs.

There's a setup step that you'll have to run once: you have to fix the
security permissions on your key file (the one that you downloaded
from Amazon when you set up your default key pair).  If you saved it
on your desktop as 'amazon.pem', you'll have to type ::

  %% chmod og-rwx ~/Desktop/amazon.pem

at the '%' prompt in Terminal app.  You only have to do this once, and
if you forget to do it, you'll get a note about security permissions
being too open.

Next, run::

  %% ssh -i ~/Desktop/amazon.pem root@ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Here, you're logging in as user 'root' to the machine
'ec2-174-129-122-189.compute-1.amazonaws.com' using the authentication
key located in 'amazon.pem' on your Desktop.  Adjust the machine name
accordingly.

On Windows:
~~~~~~~~~~~

For Windows, you'll need to download `PuTTYgen
<http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/x86/puttygen.exe>`__, use
it to open the amazon.pem file, and save the results PuTTY key as
'amazon.ppk'.  The result file can be used both by PuTTY and by WinSCP
-- to use it in PuTTY, edit the "Connection... SSH... Auth...  Private
key file for authentication" setting:

.. image:: images/putty-ssh-key.png
   :width: 50%

Assuming all of your authentication etc. is set up properly, you should
be able to log in and see a prompt that looks like this: ::

  ip-10-243-151-85:~# 

Congrats!  You have your very own cloud computer!

Getting data
------------

To get the data for the workshop, follow these brief instructions (at
the AWS/EC2 Web page):

 1. In the EC2 control tab, select 'Snapshots'.  Select "Public
    snapshots".  Search for snap-f5aa3890, which is a snapshot that
    contains the data for this workshop.  Select it, and click Create
    Volume.  Select the same availability zone as you selected above
    for your cloud machine.  Select 'create' (you don't need to
    specify a size).

    This takes a hard disk image that I created for you, which contains
    a bunch o' data, and makes your own personal copy of it.

    Note that you only need to do this once, the first time through --
    after that, the volume will be there for you to use again and again.

 2. Go to Volumes, on the left.  Select the 'empty' volume, which is the
    one you just created (there should be only one).

    Optional: If you want to name it, find the 'tags' tab and add/edit
    tags; set the value for the key=name row to something like 'my
    metag data'.  Save tags.

    Now, select 'attach volume'.  Select the name of the instance that you
    started up (again, there should only be one).  Attach as '/dev/sdf'.
    If you don't find a running instance in the menu, check to make sure that
    the instance status is green; if it's not, wait.  If it IS green, then
    try doing a full page-reload on the Web page in question.

    This takes the created hard disk image and attaches it (for the duration
    of this instance's life only) to your running instance.

At the shell ormpt on your EC2 instance, you'll need to point the
instance's operating system at the new hard drive, and give it a name.
To do this, type ::

   %% mount /dev/xvdf /data

Now, any time you reference anything under /data, you are touching on
that hard drive instance.  It's like Amazon sent you a shiny new hard
drive filled with data (5 GB in size only, to be sure) and now you've
plugged it into your instance.  Neat, eh?

Shutting down your instance
---------------------------

When you're not using your rented system, you should shut it off.  Amazon
only charges you for the periods that your system is up.

You can turn it off in *either* of two ways:

First, log in to your system and type 'shutdown -h now'.

Or, second, on the main EC2 instance screen, select the instance you
want to turn off, and click on "instance actions", and then select
"Terminate".

**Important!** After shutting down or terminating your instance, you
should always go refresh the EC2 tab at http://aws.amazon.com/ to make
sure it's off!

A few notes
-----------

You only need to set up the key file and network groups once; then
you can reuse them.

A couple of caveats
-------------------

The main caveat is this: Amazon is charging you while your instances
are running!  For now, they're just charging *me* (or this course,
really) -- but once you're done with this class, they'll be charging
*you*.  So make sure you shut down your computers when you're done with them!

Another caveat is that each time you start or stop an instance, you lose
all of the data there.    We'll talk about how to deal with that later;
for now, accept it as part of the challenge.
