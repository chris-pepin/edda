Installing assemblers (and other necessary software)
====================================================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

The first thing we need to do to make use of our Amazon machine is
to install a bunch of assemblers.

Installing khmer and screed
---------------------------

`khmer <http://khmer.readthedocs.org>`__ and `screed
<http://screed.readthedocs.org>`__ are Python packages from the `GED
Lab <http://ged.msu.edu/>`__ that are used for preprocessing short
read data and evaluating assemblers.

Install the screed package first::

   pip install git+https://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git

Let's put khmer in /usr/local/share::

   cd /usr/local/share
   git clone https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git -b bleeding-edge
   cd khmer
   make all test

You'll also need to modify the PYTHONPATH so that Python can properly
"see" khmer::

   export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/khmer/python
   echo export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/share/khmer/python >> ~/.bashrc

**Note**, here we are installing the bleeding-edge branch of khmer (as of
May 2013).  These instructions may become outdated, so if this doesn't
work right, then try omitting the '-b bleeding-edge'.

Installing Ray
--------------

Ray is `an assembler that includes Ray Meta, a metagenome assembler
<http://denovoassembler.sourceforge.net/>`__.

To install Ray, download it::

   cd /root
   curl -L 'http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/denovoassembler/Ray-v2.2.0.tar.bz2?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fdenovoassembler%2Ffiles%2F&ts=1367504021&use_mirror=superb-dca2'  > Ray-v2.2.0.tar.bz2

Unpack it::

   tar xjf Ray-v2.2.0.tar.bz2
   cd Ray-v2.2.0

and compile & copy it over::

   make
   cp Ray /usr/local/bin

Installing Velvet and MetaVelvet
--------------------------------

`Velvet <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/>`__ is a venerable
short-read assembler that is well documented and has a robust
community.  `MetaVelvet <http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp>`__ is a
metagenome-specific assembler built on top of Velvet.

Download, unpack, build and install Velvet::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/velvet_1.2.08.tgz
   tar xvzf velvet_1.2.08.tgz
   mv velvet velvet_1.2.08
   cd velvet_1.2.08
   make 'MAXKMERLENGTH=49' 'OPENMP=2'
   cp velvet? /usr/local/bin

And do the same for MetaVelvet.  Note that MetaVelvet requires Velvet,
so you'll need to run the above commands first. ::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://metavelvet.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/src/MetaVelvet-1.2.02.tgz
   tar xzf MetaVelvet-1.2.02.tgz
   make ['MAXKMERLENGTH=49'] ['CATEGORIES = cat'] ['OPENMP=2']
   cp meta-velvetg /usr/local/bin
