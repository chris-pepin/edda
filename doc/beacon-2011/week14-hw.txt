For class, consider the following questions:

   What kind of evidence is being used to infer the existence of a "4th
   domain of life"?

   What kind of additional information would you like in order to
   substantiate their hypothesis?

   What kind of information or results would *disprove* their
   hypothesis?

   What did their computational analysis pipeline look like?  (Hint: you'll
   be asked to draw it in class.)

.. Were there any arbitrary choices made in their computational pipeline?

More papers to read
-------------------

For Tuesday's class, read these:

   http://biologicinstitute.org/2008/10/17/the-genius-behind-the-ingenious/

   http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2004/04_55AR.html

   http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/EVCO_a_00005

and consider, for discussion, the differences between the genetic algorithm
design approach used in this antenna design, Drummond & Wilke's protein
folding simulation, and Avida.  Do they all have the same goals?  Do they
use similar techniques?  What are the similarities and differences between
the evolution techniques?

Computational HW (due Wednesday, Dec 7th, at midnight)
------------------------------------------------------

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Run through :doc:`../tutorials-2011/short-read-assembly-velvet`, using AMI
ami-67fe300e.  The data is on snapshot snap-000d346e, so you'll need
to create a volume from that snapshot and mount it as /dev/xvdf.  (See
:doc:`running-and-saving-avida-results` for snapshot/volume basics.)

Once you complete your first assembly, grab the khmer and screed
source code::

   %% git clone git://github.com/ctb/screed.git
   %% cd screed
   %% python setup.py install
   %% cd ..

   %% git clone git://github.com/ctb/khmer.git

and use the 'assemstats3.py' script to look at the contigs.fa file::

   %% python khmer/scripts/assemstats3.py 200 */contigs.fa

What is assemstats reporting?  What values are you looking for here?

Try assembling with different 'k' values (e.g. 33 instead of 31, or 29
instead of 31).  Which assembly is the best?  On what criterion?

(See the Miller paper from :doc:`week5-hw` for info on assembly.)

Send me (ctb@msu.edu) the first sequence from the best assembly (the
one you chose).  You can get this sequence by enabling Dropbox and
doing ::

   %% python
   >>> import screed
   >>> sequences = list(screed.open('dirname/contigs.fa'))
   >>> fp = open('/root/Dropbox/output.txt', 'w')
   >>> fp.write(sequences[0].sequence)

where you replace 'dirname' with the name of the assembly directory, e.g.
'k31'.
 
Type CTRL-D to exit the Python prompt.
