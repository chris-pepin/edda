Week 7 - More assembly; k-mers
==============================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Reminder: a k-mer is just a fixed length word of DNA.  Re-read the Miller
paper sections on de Bruijn graphs if you need reminding!

Homework 7
----------

Start up a small instance.

Go through the instructions in :doc:`week7-khmer`; then:

1. Connect to the ipython notebook server, read update the notebooks,
   and read through hw-week7-fake-genome.  Answer the questions at the
   end.

2. Also, fill in code for Problems 1 and 2 in the notebook
   'hw-week7-data-parsing-again'.
