Installing khmer.
=================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

So far, we've mostly been working with pre-installed software -- which
just means that someone *else* has gone to the trouble of finding it,
downloading it, compiling it, and installing it.  Velvet was your first
taste of this process; this week, we're going to continue with two
software from the Brown lab, 'screed' and 'khmer'.

Log into your Amazon server, and following the instructions below to install
these two pieces of software.

First, install 'screed'.  screed is a Python library for working with
short-read data sets.  We're going to install it directly from the
development location on github. ::

  %% cd /usr/local/share
  %% git clone git://github.com/ged-lab/screed.git
  %% cd screed
  %% python setup.py install

Next, install 'khmer'.  khmer is a Python library for working with large
numbers of k-mers.  Again, we'll install it directly from the development
location on github. ::

  %% cd /usr/local/share
  %% git clone git://github.com/ged-lab/khmer.git
  %% cd khmer
  %% make
  %% cd python
  %% python setup.py install

functionality in class.
