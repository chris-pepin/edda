6. Mapping and abundance quantitation
=====================================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Let's do some simple mapping to do abundance estimation in the group 5
assembly.

Setup
=====

First, move to a new directory::

   cd 
   mkdir mapping
   cd mapping

   cp /class/cbrown/data/group5-assembly.fa.gz .

   gunzip group5-assembly.fa

Bowtie mapping
==============

`bowtie <http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml>`__ is a commonly
used mapping tool.

We need to build a bowtie reference::

   bowtie-build group5-assembly.fa group5

and then let's map a subset of the reads (make it the single-ended ones,
just to keep things fast)::

   gunzip -c ~/data/SRR492065.se.qc.fq.gz | \
         	  bowtie -q group5 - > SRR492065.x.group5.map
   gunzip -c ~/data/SRR492066.se.qc.fq.gz | \
        	  bowtie -q group5 - > SRR492066.x.group5.map

Here you should see the following output for the first::

   # reads processed: 802158
   # reads with at least one reported alignment: 63226 (7.88%)
   # reads that failed to align: 738932 (92.12%)
   Reported 63226 alignments to 1 output stream(s)

and the second::

   # reads processed: 904157
   # reads with at least one reported alignment: 39572 (4.38%)
   # reads that failed to align: 864585 (95.62%)
   Reported 39572 alignments to 1 output stream(s)

At the moment, there seems to be no good way to do automated differential
analysis of two samples, so I'll content myself with showing you how to
annotate the assembled sequences with the mapping abundances.

To do this, we will need to make two copies of the annotated assembly
-- one annotated with the first (SRR492065) and the other with the
second (SRR492066) abundances. ::

   python /class/stamps-software/share/khmer/sandbox/make-coverage.py group5-assembly.fa SRR492065.x.group5.map
   mv group5-assembly.fa.cov group5.SRR492065.fa

   python /class/stamps-software/share/khmer/sandbox/make-coverage.py group5-assembly.fa SRR492066.x.group5.map
   mv group5-assembly.fa.cov group5.SRR492066.fa

What you should see now is that there's a [cov] annotation for each
sequence in every file -- ::

   head -1 group5.SRR49206?.fa

and you should see something like this --

   ==> group5.SRR492065.fa <==
   >NODE_1_length_3642_cov_7.200439[cov=1]

   ==> group5.SRR492066.fa <==
   >NODE_1_length_3642_cov_7.200439[cov=2]

This format can be uploaded directly to MG-RAST as an
abundance-annotated assembly, although there's no good way to do
comparative analysis yet, it seems.

More generally, I would suggest looking into things like `RSEM
<http://deweylab.biostat.wisc.edu/rsem/>`__, `DEseq
<http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/DESeq/>`__, or other
differential expression packages for mRNAseq.
