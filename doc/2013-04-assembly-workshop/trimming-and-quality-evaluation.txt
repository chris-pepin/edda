Trimming and quality evaluation of your sequences
=================================================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Start at the EC2 login prompt.  Then, ::

  cd /mnt

Make a directory to store all your trimmed data in, and go there::

  mkdir trim
  cd trim

Now, run 'Trimmomatic' to eliminate Illumina adapters -- ::

  java -jar /usr/local/bin/trimmomatic-0.27.jar PE ../ecoli_ref-5m_s1.fq ../ecoli_ref-5m_s2.fq s1_pe s1_se s2_pe s2_se ILLUMINACLIP:../illuminaClipping.fa:2:30:10

Next, let's take a look at data quality using FastQC::

   mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc
   /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc s1_* s2_* --outdir=/root/Dropbox/fastqc

This will dump the FastQC output into your Dropbox folder, under
the folder 'fastqc'.  Go check it out -- you're looking for folders
named <filename>_fastqc, for example 's1_pe_fastqc'; then double
click on 'fastqc_report.html'.

It looks like a lot of bad data is present after base 70, so let's just trim
all the sequences that way.  Before we do that, we want to interleave the
reads again (don't ask) -- ::

   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/interleave.py s1_pe s2_pe > combined.fq

Now, let's use the FASTX toolkit to trim off bases over 70, and
eliminate low-quality sequences.  We need to do this both for our
combined/paired files and our remaining single-ended files::

   fastx_trimmer -Q33 -l 70 -i combined.fq | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > combined-trim.fq

   fastx_trimmer -Q33 -l 70 -i s1_se | fastq_quality_filter -Q33 -q 30 -p 50 > s1_se.filt

Let's take a look at what we have -- ::

   ls -la

You should see::

  drwxr-xr-x 2 root root       4096 2013-04-08 03:33 .
  drwxr-xr-x 4 root root       4096 2013-04-08 03:21 ..
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  802243778 2013-04-08 03:33 combined-trim.fq
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1140219324 2013-04-08 03:26 combined.fq
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  570109662 2013-04-08 03:23 s1_pe
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     407275 2013-04-08 03:23 s1_se
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root     319878 2013-04-08 03:33 s1_se.filt
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root  570109662 2013-04-08 03:23 s2_pe
  -rw-r--r-- 1 root root          0 2013-04-08 03:22 s2_se

Let's run FastQC on things again, too::

   mkdir /root/Dropbox/fastqc.filt
   /usr/local/share/FastQC/fastqc combined-trim.fq s1_se.filt --outdir=/root/Dropbox/fastqc.filt

Now go look in your Dropbox folder under 'fastqc.filt', folder
'combined-trim.fq_fastqc' -- looks a lot better, eh?
