Installing and running BLAST
============================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols

Everyone wants to BLAST!  How do we do it?

First, install NCBI BLAST::

   cd /root
   curl -O http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/2.2.26/blast-2.2.26-x64-linux.tar.gz
   tar xzf blast-2.2.26-x64-linux.tar.gz

   cp blast-2.2.26/bin/* /usr/local/bin

Now, go back to your working area::

   cd /mnt
   mkdir blast
   cd blast

Now grab a protein sequence -- ::

   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/ecoli-prots.fa

This can actually be any FASTA file with any number of protein or nucleotide sequences in it.  Here, we've just chosen CRP and RecA.

First, let's format our assembly::

   cp ../velvet/ecoli.31/contigs.fa .
   formatdb -i contigs.fa -o T -p F

And, now you can do a BLAST::

   blastall -i ecoli-prots.fa -d contigs.fa -p tblastn | less

...tada...
