Getting the data
================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 

Start at your EC2 prompt, then type ::

   cd /mnt

Now, grab the 5m E. coli reads from our data storage (originally from
`Chitsaz et al. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21926975>`__)::

   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz

You can take a look at the file contents by doing::
 
   gunzip -c ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz | less

(use 'q' to quit the viewer).  This is what raw FASTQ looks like!

Note that in this case we've given you the data *interleaved*, which
means that paired ends appear next to each other in the file.  Most of
the time sequencing facilities will give you data that is split out
into s1 and s2 files.  We'll need to split it out into these files for
some of the trimming steps, so let's do that -- ::

   python /usr/local/share/khmer/sandbox/split-pe.py ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz
   mv ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz.1 ecoli_ref-5m_s1.fq
   mv ecoli_ref-5m.fastq.gz.2 ecoli_ref-5m_s2.fq

We'll also need to get some Illumina adapter information -- here::

   curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/public.ged.msu.edu/illuminaClipping.fa
