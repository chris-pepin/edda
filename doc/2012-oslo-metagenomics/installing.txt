Installing the necessary software on the cod servers
====================================================

.. Warning:: These documents are not maintained and their instructions may be
	out of date. However the GED Lab does maintain the `khmer protocols
	<http://khmer-protocols.readthedocs.org/>`__ which may cover similar
	topics. See also the `installation instructions for the current version
	of the khmer project <https://khmer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html>`__. 


This should all run on cod3::

   %% ssh guestXXX@cod3.uio.no

Configuring your account (first time)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Load modules::

   %% module load python2 velvet

Configure locale::

   %% export LC_CTYPE=C

Create a virtualenv that will let you install Python packages all for
yourself::

   %% python -m virtualenv ~/env
   %% . ~/env/bin/activate

Compiling software (only once)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install 'nose' testing framework::

  %% easy_install -U nose

Install 'screed' FASTA/FASTQ reader: grab
~guest384/software/screed-master.tar.gz (this is the same as
https://github.com/ged-lab/screed/archive/master.tar.gz)::

  %% pip install ~guest384/software/screed-master.tar.gz

Install khmer: Grab ~guest384/software/khmer-master.tar.gz (this is
the same as https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/archive/master.tar.gz,
if you want to update it later or install it again.) ::

   %% cd ~/
   %% cp ~guest384/software/khmer-master.tar.gz .
   %% tar xzf khmer-master.tar.gz
   %% mv khmer-master khmer
   %% cd khmer

   %% make CFLAGS=-fPIC

If this is successful, next do::

   %% nosetests

(You may need to do '. ~/env/bin/activate' again...)

They should all pass.

Optional - installing Dropbox on cod3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to be able to use Dropbox to transfer files to and from
cod3, you can do the following.  (Note that you need to have Dropbox
already configured and installed on your laptop!) ::

  %% mkdir /tmp/$USER
  %% cd /tmp/$USER
  %% wget -O dropbox.tar.gz "http://www.dropbox.com/download/?plat=lnx.x86_64"
  %% tar xzf dropbox.tar.gz
  %% cp -r .dropbox-dist ~/
  %% cd
  %% ~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd &

You should now see a message like this::

  This client is not linked to any account... Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/cli_link?host_id=XXXXX to link this machine.

Visit that URL and log into dropbox.com.  From now on, ~/Dropbox/ on
the cluster will be connected to your Dropbox account; if you put a
file there on cod3, it will show up on your laptop, and vice versa.

Configuring your account (each time)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In each session, you need to do the following.

Load modules::

   %% module load python2 velvet

Activate your Python virtual environment::

   %% . ~/env/bin/activate

Set your PYTHONPATH to include khmer/python::

   %% export PYTHONPATH=~/khmer/python
